    "description": "Microcontroller library for basic management of elapsed time, wall time, and date time with multi-timezone support. Provides type safety around durations and different time units, guarding against common programming errors like confusing time units, or confusing 'timestamps' with 'durations'. Tested on ESP32 SOC family (both Arduino and esp-idf), and RP2040-based Raspberry Pi Pico",
